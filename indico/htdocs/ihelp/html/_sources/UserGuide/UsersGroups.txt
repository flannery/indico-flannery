Chapter 5. Users and Groups
===========================

5.1. Users

Recognized Users are either Indico locally registered users, NICE
users, or users with CERN light-weight accounts.

Recognized Groups are either Indico locally created groups (only
Administrators can create such groups), NICE groups,
or e-groups. We strongly recommend the use of SIMBA lists 
as groups of users in Indico.
