Dear CHEP04 presenters,

On behalf of the Programme Committee (PC) I would like to thank all of you for the excellent talks and posters presented last week at CHEP04. We thank especially those of you (the majority) who have already submitted your paper for publication in the proceedings. The PC will now start to process these papers and you may be contacted in the case any changes are required.

We have received several requests for a short extension of the deadline. In order to accommodate these requests the deadline for submission of papers is hereby extended until October 15th. We would be very grateful if you will respect this deadline so that we can get the proceedings published in a timely manner.

many thanks in advance for your cooperation,

John Harvey

Chair Programme Committee
