Category
---------

A Category is a means of grouping your events or other Categories 
together. In Indico *Home* is the top level category from where you
start. Inside a category you can:

* add events or other sub-categories,
* set access rights to say who can access or modify,
* re-allocate the sub-categories, 
* remove the sub-categories, 
* and also delete the current category and everything inside it.

These features are accessible through the menu *Manage* (you must be logged in 
and with modification rights in order to see it), that you can find close to the
big orange category name. After clicking *Manage* (more specifically its inner 
option *Edit category*) you will be accessing the Management area for Category.


Creating a Category
-------------------

From the menu *Manage* (more specifically its inner 
option *Add subcategory*) you can create a new category. 
You will need to have an Administrator's account or be listed
in the modification list `(see Protection) <#protection>`_ 
for the category. 

Also you can create it from the Management area, from the menu
*General settings* `(See General Settings) <#general-settings>`_  
and by clicking the button *add subcateg*.

Protection 
~~~~~~~~~~

From the Management Area you can protect your category using the
three controls for access levels: Modification control, Access control,
and Domain control. You can add Users or Groups to the Modification
and Access control lists.

|image3|

*Modification Control* Category Managers can be added to a
category to allow access to the Management Area for modification.
Category managers are either those listed in the modification
control list, or Indico administrators. The creator of a category
will be able to modify it without being listed.

*Access Control* A category can be public or private; Public: Anyone
can view a public category and any user can add events to it.
However, users will only be able to see the events inside the
category to which they have access. Private: Only those users in
the access list or administrators can access the category and add
events. When a Category is made private, the option for domain
control is omitted and any event or category made inside it will also
be private. The category will be displayed with "(protected)" after
its name to show it is private.

*Domain Control* The access to the Category can be restricted by domain.
Therefore, just the users from the chosen domain will be able to access 
(e.g. If we choose the domain CERN, just users from inside CERN will
be able to access the category and its content).

*Conference Creation Tool* You can restrict who is able to add
events to the category. If you restrict it, you need to add
users or groups to the list in order to allow them to add events.

Detail Modification & Sub-Category/Event Organisation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The details of a Category can be modified and sub-categories can
be organised from the *General settings* tab in the management area. 
Details can be modified by clicking on modify inside the main tab.
Sub-categories and events can be organised in the particular order
in which you wish to view them by using the order drop down box next
to each sub-category.

|image5|

You can re-allocate a sub-category or event by selecting the one
you wish to move using the tick box and clicking on re-allocate,
you will then be asked to where you would like to reallocate this
sub-category/event. 

To remove a sub-category and anything it contains or an event, 
select it and click *remove*. If it contains anything you will be 
asked if you are sure you want to delete it.

--------------

Deleting a Category
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To delete the current category you can go to the Tools menu in the
Management Area and select 'Delete this category' you
will be asked to confirm the deletion first.
