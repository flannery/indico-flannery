Conference
----------

A conference is the most comprehensive event in Indico.
You should be able to manage its complete life-cycle,
for instance, among other functionalities you can setup:

* a conference web portal fully customizable
* the programme definition (with themes/topics/tracks)
* a registration form with e-payment capabilities
* a call for abstracts to be submitted
* an abstract review process
* a timetable with many sessions and presentations
* slides and papers submission by authors
* an evaluation form in order to get feedback after the conference
* emails to participants

--------------

Creating a Conference
---------------------

In order to create a conference, you just need to click on
*Create event* and *Create conference*, in blue bar at the top of
the page. You will be presented with a form in which you:

1. choose the category where you want to place your conference and
2. fill the details of the conference you wish to create.

Once this is done your conference will be created and you will be
redirected to the Management Area of the conference. If you want
to see the Home page of your conference, click in the link *View
event page*.

The creator of this conference will by default have modification
rights to it and is referred to as a Conference Manager as is anyone
else listed in the Modification control list.

Remember that the category, in which you want to create your conference,
must be public or you must have access rights to it.

To access the Management Area of a conference you need to
click on the modification icon |image7| in the top bar of the event
home page.


--------------

Setting up a Conference
-----------------------

Once your conference has been created the Conference Manager can start
setting up the conference from the Management Area.

* Set up your Access Control to restrict or allow users the rights to access or modify the conference `(see Access Control Management) <#access-control-management>`_.
* Look at customizing the look of your conference when users come to view it `(see Layout Management) <#layout-management>`_.
* Start adding Tracks to your conference to define areas to help with organisation. A Track Manager can be assigned to each track to co-ordinate which abstracts to accept into these tracks `(see Programme Management) <#programme-management>`_.
* Start calling for abstracts. Abstracts are proposed contributions to your conference. By default, when you first create a conference, calling for abstracts is disabled. You can enable this in *Abstracts* `(see Abstracts Management) <#abstracts-management>`_.
* Start looking at which submitted abstracts you wish to accept into your conference, they will then become contributions `(see Contributions Management) <#contributions-management>`_.
* Start setting up a Timetable to organize what will be happening where, and when, and what contributions, materials, etc, will be included `(see Timetable Management) <#timetable-management>`_.
* If those that will attend your conference need to register, give details concerning their needs while at the conference, or pay the fees, you can set up a registration form `(see Registration Management) <#registration-management>`_.
* There are options to make offline versions of your conference, to clone your conference, and to perform other tasks on the whole of your conference once you set it up `(see Conference Tools) <#conference-tools>`_.

--------------

Conference Management Area
--------------------------

The Management Area allows you to control, manage, setup and
modify the different parts of your conference. The following
sections will show each area of the Conference Management.

of the tracks `(see Tracks below) <#tracks>`_

|image12|

--------------

Tracks
^^^^^^

Tracks are parts of the conference to which abstracts and
contributions can belong. Inside tracks you can do the
following:

* General settings:

  - Modify the Code: a code can be used if you prefer to use codes as opposed to using long titles. This codes will be used in listings for contributions and abstracts.
  - Modify the Title and the Description of the track.

|image13|

* Coordination Control: Assign *Track Manager(s)* who can decide what is accepted into their Track. Track Managers do not have modification access to the rest of the conference, they have access only to the modification of their Track.

|image14|

* Abstracts: Show any abstracts which have been submitted to the Track, the Track Manager can then propose to accept or reject it. Only the Conference Manager can have the final say in whether an abstract is accepted or rejected `(see Abstracts Management) <#abstracts-management>`_.

* Contributions: Show any contributions that belong to that Track `(see Contributions Management) <#contributions-management>`_.


--------------

Sub-contributions can be added to a contribution to organize the
contribution further.

|image20|

From inside each sub-contribution you can modify the general
details, add or remove presenters, and attach material in the same way as
you can for contributions. From the Tools tab in a sub-contribution
you can delete that sub-contribution or write the minutes for it,
these will be attached to the material for the sub-contribution.

--------------

Material
^^^^^^^^

Material can be submitted by a user once the abstract has been
accepted and made into a contribution. Material can also be added
by the Conference Manager directly to the conference, or to a
contribution or sub-contribution.

You can upload files or simply add URL links.

|image21|

Access rights can be set for each material. From inside Access Control
you can list those users that can view the material.

|image22|

--------------

Abstracts Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Abstracts Management in Indico has four tabs:

* Setup: configuration of the call for abstracts.
* Preview: preview of the submission form.
* List of Abstracts: all the abstracts that have been submitted or
  created by the organizers.
* Book of Abstracts Setup.

--------------

Call for Abstracts Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The call for abstracts needs to be enabled first from the *Setup*
tab. From here you can set:

* Submission period: dates between authors can submit abstracts.
* Modification deadline: deadline for any abstract modification.
* Announcement: information displayed in the home page of the event when
  accessing the call for abstracts menu.
* Submission notification: email addresses that will receive an email
  every time someone submits an abstract.
  You can also add any
* Misc. options: in the abstract submission, the author must choose the tracks
  or topics for his abstract. The conference organizer can make the choice
  mandatory and multiple.
* Abstract fields: you can add/remove more fields to the abstract submission
  form.
* Late submission authorised users: users that can submit abstracts after the
  deadline.
* Notification templates: `see Notification Template <#notification-template>`_.

|image23|

--------------

Notification Template
'''''''''''''''''''''

A notification template is an email template that the conference
organizer can pre-defined and that will be automatically used by
Indico  under certain circumstances (when an abstract is accepted,
rejected or merged).

In order to create a Notification Template you have to:

1. Go to Abstracts menu, Setup tab and scroll down in that page. You will see
   the section *Notification templates*.
2. Click in *add* button and fill up the form. Here the definition for each
   field:

   1. Title: This is just a title for the notification template. It is
      just a definition of the template. It will not be used in the email.
   2. Description: This is just a description for the notification
      template. It will not be used in the email.
   3. From address: the FROM address in the automatic email.
   4. To addresses: who will receive the email, submitters and/or primary
      authors of the abstracts.
   5. CC addresses: extra email addresses that will receive the notification.
   6. Subject: subject of the email.
   7. Body: body of the email. You can customize the body by adding special
      tags on it. This tags will be replaced with the information of the abstract
      like: title, id, URL, submitter family name, etc. Be careful to write
      perfectly the tags or the email will not work. The format is something
      like this:

::

    %(conference_title)s

3. Save the template. You will see your template in the list.
4. Click in the title of the template and access its management area.
5. Set the condition under with the email will be sent:

   1. choose the condition: in status ACCEPTED, REJECTED or MERGED.
   2. click *create new condition*.
   3. For ACCEPTED and REJECTED, you need to specify if this applies to
      any contribution type and track, or just to a concrete one.
   4. submit the condition.
6. Done. This template will be used under the condition that you have chosen on the
   step 5. Therefore, Indico will automatically send the email of step 2 to the
   email address specified on step 2.4. and 2.5.

|image24|

--------------

List of Abstracts Tab
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The List of Abstracts tab shows all the abstracts that have been
submitted to the conference:

|image25|

From the List of Abstracts tab you can add new abstracts, create PDFs of
the abstracts, create an XML file of abstracts, and obtain the authors
list. You can also access each abstract `see Abstracts <#abstracts>`_;
an abstract can be in one of 10 states:

* Accepted |image26|
* Rejected |image27|
* Proposed Rejection |image28|
* Withdrawn |image29|
* Merged |image30|
* Submitted |image31|
* Under Review |image32|
* Duplicated |image33|
* Proposed Acceptation |image34|
* Conflict |image35|
 
As for contributions, there is a *Filtering criteria* panel that you can
open by clicking in the little gray arrow. You can choose the type of abstracts
you want to display and apply it to the list.

--------------

Abstracts
^^^^^^^^^

An abstract is either submitted by a user or manually
added by a Abstract Manager (conference organizers). Once an
abstract is accepted it is automatically changed into a contribution
and added to the contributions list in the conference
`(see Contributions Management) <#contributions-management>`_.

|image36|

From inside Abstract Management, the Conference Manager can change
the status of an abstract, for example, by accepting it or marking it as a
duplicate.

The main details of the abstract can be modified and the track to
which it is associated can be changed as well as the user that
submitted it. Any comments made by the Track Manager or Conference
Manager while changing the status of the abstract can be viewed
from the tab *Track judgements*.

|image37|

Internal comments can be made from the tab *Internal comments* (it's like
a message box). And a notification log, with the emails sent to the author,
can also be viewed from inside the tab *Notification log*.

--------------

Book of Abstracts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *Book of Abstracts* tab lets you add any additional comments
that you would like to appear in the first page of the book of Abstracts.
This is a PDF file which can be generated from the conference home page
`(see Conference Display) <#conference-display-area>`_ containing all the
abstracts.

--------------

Timetable Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can organise your conference from the Timetable tab in a conference.
When you start with a timetable it will look like this:

|image38|

You can modify the start and end dates of the timetable, and you
can start adding sessions, breaks, and contributions to your
timetable.

|image39|

In order to edit the entries in the timetable, you just need to click
on the entry box and edition balloon will show up.

--------------

Sessions
^^^^^^^^

A session is essentially a time interval within which you organise many
presentations of your conference. You can create sessions base on
different reasons:

* You could use a session for each track, for example.
* There can also be more than one session scheduled at the same time
  (parallel sessions).
* The same session can also be happing in different time intervals. For
  example, you may have a morning interval, then a break, and then an afternoon
  interval within the same session. Also, one day you have a session on a
  particular subject for a couple of hours and then two days later you may have
  another session on that subject. This can be done using *Add new* > *Session*
  > *Add interval to:* an already existing session (see previous image).

--------------

Adding Sessions and Breaks to a Timetable
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To add a session to your timetable, use the menu *Add new* and the
option *Session* > *Create a new session*, at the top of the timetable.
This will present you with a form that you fill in with the details of
your session. Once the session is created it will appear in your timetable.

|image40|

From the same menu *Add new* but in the option *Break* you can add a break.

In order to modify sessions and breaks, you need to click on the entry and
an edition balloon will be displayed. For sessions, you can edit their
inner timetable with their own contributions and breaks, from the edition
balloon and the link *View and edit current interval timetable*.

--------------

Adding Contributions to a Timetable
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To add a contribution to your timetable use the option *Add new* > *Contribution*.
Here, there are two possible situations:

1. If there are already some unscheduled contributions `(see Contributions
Management) <#contributions-management>`_, Indico will show a list of then in
which you can select the contribution(s) you want to add. Also, you can choose
to create a new one.

|image41|

2. If there are not unscheduled contributions, the form for the creation of
a new contribution will be shown.

|image42|

As for sessions and breaks, you can edit a contribution by clicking on its entry
box and using the edition balloon.

--------------

Session Management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can access the Management area for a session from the edition
balloon (this is the balloon that appears when clicking on the entry),
by clicking *Edit* > *Session properties*.

|image97|

This new page will allow to modify everything within that Session.
You will see different tabs from which you can:

* Edit the general settings.
* Manage the list of contributions for that session.
* Modify the inner timetable for that session.
* Write some comments that other session coordinators can read.
* Attach files.
* Set its protection and the coordinators (people with rights just to
  schedule talks).

|image98|

--------------

Intervals
'''''''''

A session can happen in different intervals of time.
If you already have a session (which will be like the first interval)
and you want to add more intervals for that session, you can do it from
the menu (in the top bar of the timetable)  *Add new* > *Session*  >
*Add interval to:* an already existing session.

However, this is optional, intervals can be used when the session takes
place over more than one period of time. For example, if you may have a
morning interval, then a break, and then an afternoon interval within the
same session. Also, you may have one day you have a session on a particular
subject for a couple of hours and then two days later you may have another
session on that subject.

--------------

Main Tab
''''''''

From the Main tab in Session you can, modify the general session
information and add conveners.

--------------

Contributions Tab
'''''''''''''''''

From the Contributions tab you can see all the contributions that
are part of your session. These contributions will only be shown
once they have been added
`(see Adding Contributions to Sessions) <#adding-contributions-to-sessions>`_.

--------------

Protection Tab
''''''''''''''

From the Protection tab in Session you can set the access
rights for modification, access, and domain control in the same way as you
can for the conference `(see Protection Management) <#protection-management>`_.
The only difference is the Co-ordination control in which you can assign
someone to be the Co-ordinator, which means they can add and remove contributions
and breaks to that particular session.

--------------

Tools Tab
'''''''''

From the Tools tab in Session you can delete that session or
write minutes for the session.

--------------

Adding Contributions to Sessions
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Inside sessions, you can create new contributions from the timetable
or add unscheduled contributions (which have already been created
and will be placed in the timetable later on). Here, we will see
how to add/import contributions that have already been created.

To add contributions to a session you first need to import them
from the main conference, to do this use the *Contribution* tab
inside the session:

|image46|

Click on *import contributions*, this will take you to a screen
where you can select the contributions you want to include in your
session.

|image47|

Once you have selected the contributions they will appear inside
the Contributions tab in the session. You can then use the option
*Add new* > *Contribution* from the Session timetable and select
from the contributions you imported. When you have added a contribution
to your session timetable you can edit the times and duration by clicking
on the contribution box.

|image48|

--------------

Protection Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Protection in a conference is similar to that in a Category `(see
Protection) <Categories.html#protection>`_.
There is Modification Control, Domain Control and Access Control.
When adding to the Access and Modification lists, you can also add
Groups of users if any have been defined by Administration.

*Modification Control* Only the Managers listed in the
Modification Control, the Creator of the conference, and any
Administrators can access the Management Area of the
conference. However, you can add a Modification Key which means
anyone with this key can modify the conference without logging in.

*Access Control* When the conference is public, anyone can view
the conference including the programme, timetable, abstracts, etc.
When the conference is private, only those in the Access List,
Conference Managers and Administrators can view the conference.

|image49|

When private you can also add an Access Key which means anyone
with this key can access the conference without logging in. Users
will get a message as the following:

|image50|

*Domain Control* This option is only for public events. It allows
to specify which domain (e.g. CERN) can access the conference.
Therefore, just people from inside this domain will be able to access.

--------------

Registration Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may wish to have some kind of registration process for those
attending your conference. Here you can give the registrants
options such as accommodation or any specific needs. The Registration
Management comes in two parts: the Registration Form and the
