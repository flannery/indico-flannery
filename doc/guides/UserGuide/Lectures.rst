Lecture
-------

A Lecture is the simplest form of event within Indico. A
Lecture allows you to add material, give details about the lecture,
and set the access control. You also have Tools in which you can
remove, clone, and set alarms.

--------------

Creating a Lecture
------------------

If you have the correct access rights within a Category you can
create a new lecture using the *Create event* > *Lecture* from the
blue top bar.
You will be presented with a form similar to that for a Meeting;
you are able to choose the default style in which the
Lecture will be displayed `(See Lecture Display Area) <#lecture-display-area>`_.
After you submit this form the Lecture will be created and you will
be redirected to its Management Area.

--------------

Lecture Management Area
-----------------------

The Management Area allows you to control the different parts of
your lecture. The following sections will show each area of the
Lecture Management.

--------------

General Settings Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From the *General settings* menu, you are able to modify the details of the
lecture including title, description, location, dates, speakers, and default
style of the display.

Clicking on the link *View event page* will take you to the
home page of your event.

--------------

Material
^^^^^^^^

You can add material to the lecture, by using the *Material* menu, and
the link *Add Material*.
You can then enter the name and description of the material.

The material can be files or links. You also protect the material
to control who has access to view the material.

--------------

Protection Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Protection Management in a lecture is the same as that in a Meeting.
There is Modification Control, Domain Control and Access Control.
When adding to the Access and Modification lists, you can also add
Groups of users if any have been defined by Administration.

*Modification Control* Only the managers listed in the
modification control, the creator of the lecture, and any
administrators can access the Management Area of the lecture.
However, you can add a Modification Key which means anyone with this
key can modify the lecture without logging in.

|image145|

*Access Control* When the lecture is public, anyone can view the
lecture . When the lecture is private, only those in the access
list, lecture managers, and administrators can view the lecture.

|image146|

When private you can also add an Access Key which means anyone
with this key can access the lecture without logging in.

*Domain Control* This is available when the lecture is
public. You can specify which domain can access the lecture. For
instance, users accessing from a computer in the CERN domain will
be able to access.

--------------

Tools Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The lecture Tools allow you to carry out certain actions on the whole
of the lecture.

be asked to confirm deletion beforehand.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Clone the lecture if you would like to make another lecture exactly the
same. You have the option to clone it once, at fixed intervals,
or on certain dates.

Using the *Material Package* option you can create a package
of all the materials that have been used in the lecture.

--------------

Alarm Control
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can set an alarm/reminder to alert people about the
lecture; the alert will be in the form of an email.

|image152|

--------------

Lecture Display Area
--------------------

The Lecture Display is the view that users of the lecture will
see. If the lecture is public they will not need to log in to view
the lecture. It is also the area in which you can access the
modification areas if you have access rights. There are various
views in which the lecture can be displayed; the following sections
show the different views and displays of the different parts of a
lecture. 

--------------

Lecture Style
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the default view for lectures in Indico. If you have
modification rights to any parts in the lecture, you will be able
to access the Management Area by clicking the modification icon |image155|. 

You can also do some management actions from the tab *Manage* on the right
of the title.
